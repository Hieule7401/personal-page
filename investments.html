  <h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>
  <p>I love to invest in dividend stocks as it is a good way to diversify my income
    streams and to create real passive income. In my opinion, the two most important
    lessons I have learned are don't try to time the market and know the ins and outs
    of your companies.
