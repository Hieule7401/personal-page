  <p>I am currently a student at CSUS studying Computer Science.
    My personal interests are learning about <a href="investments.html">personal finance</a>,
    watching the NBAüèÄ, and working out/exercisingüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. My favorite team
    is the Sacramento Kings, because that is my hometown. My favorite stocks
    are Apple, JP Morgan, and Costco. My favorite way to exercise is to play
    basketball and weightlift. I like to code on my freetime and would love to
    learn as much as I can about the skill, not only to further my professional
    career, but to also expand the possibilities of my personal projects.
